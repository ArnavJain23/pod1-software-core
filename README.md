## Git & Development Workflow ##

## Before you start... ##
- Files more than a few MB in size should not pushed to the repo unless there is a good reason
- **Always** check what files you're about to commit before doing so. `git status`
- No binaries or automatically generated files should ever be committed. (Unless there is a very very very good reason)

## GIT Workflow ##
